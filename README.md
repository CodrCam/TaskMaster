### Add a Task

Users can add a new task by clicking the "Add Task" button on the homepage. This will open a new page where users can type in the title and body of the new task. Clicking the "Submit" button will add the task to the list and return the user to the homepage.

### Remove a Task

Users can remove the last task from their list by clicking the "Remove Task" button on the homepage. If there are no tasks to remove, a message will be displayed.
